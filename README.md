- 👋 Hi, I’m Dakota, the Founder & Co-Owner/C.O.O of Bowman Flooring Co.
- 👀 I’m interested in making the world a better place by first becoming a better person.
- 👀          
- 👀          It's only fair to everyone else, right??...
- 👀         🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate technology, specifically web development and web applications, into the floor covering industry.  
- 🌱 By day, I install my specific brand of floor coverings. By night, I code code code code code zzzzz.....
- 💞️ I’ve recently moved on from the idea of using ERPNext as my company's online HQ. So, I'm now working on designing and implementing an entire web-app myself! It's built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. Initially, it will just be a portal for customers to post pictures of their old/new floors, status updates, etc. From there, it will hopefully grow and blossom into the full-featured powerhouse of a web-app that I know it has the potential to become! 
- 🤓 I would like to collaborate on some nodejs projects. I am a complete beginner, so a learning strategy (even some lessons, tips, and tricks) would be a big help.
