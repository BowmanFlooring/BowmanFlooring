- 👋 Hi, I’m Dakota, the Founder & Co-Owner/C.O.O of Bowman Flooring Co.
- 👀 I’m interested in making the world a better place by first becoming a better person.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate technology, specifically web development and 
- 🌱  web applications, into the floor covering industry. By day, I install my specific 
- 🌱  brand of floor coverings. By night, I code code code code code zzzzz.....
- 🌱  I'm working on designing a series of packages that will exist as a web app, built
- 🌱  specifically for communication between my clients and our team - from upper
- 🌱  management down to employees. 
- 💞️ I’ve recently moved on from the idea of using ERPNext as
- 💞️   my LLC's online HQ... 
- 🤓 I would like to collaborate on some nodejs projects. I am a 
- 🤓   complete beginner, so a learning strategy (even some 
- 🤓   lessons/tips/tricks) would be a big help.
